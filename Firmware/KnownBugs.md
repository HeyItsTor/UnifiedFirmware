## SD Boot Loop ##
**Issue:** Some printers will not boot fully when an SD is left in the SD slot. This appears to happen commonly on the MKS Robin series with the TFT touch LCDs.

**Workaround:** Remove the SD card after flashing and/or power cycle. We are looking into a fix and once it is located we will patch it.
